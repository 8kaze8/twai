# Questions:

TAM - SAM - SOM :

To calculate the Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Available Market
(SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) for an e-commerce SaaS platform,
you can integrate both structured methodologies and practical examples as
follows:

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

- **Definition**: TAM is the total revenue opportunity available if your product
  or service achieves 100% market share.
- **Calculation**:
- **Formula**: TAM = Total number of potential users \* Average revenue per user
- **Approach**:

1. Identify the total number of e-commerce businesses globally.
2. Estimate the average annual revenue per e-commerce business using your
   platform.

- **Example**: If there are 10 million e-commerce businesses worldwide and the
  average annual revenue per user is $2,000, then:
- TAM = 10,000,000 \* $2,000 = $20 billion

### Serviceable Available Market (SAM)

- **Definition**: SAM is the segment of the TAM targeted by your products and
  services which is within your geographical reach.
- **Calculation**:
- **Formula**: SAM = (Total number of potential customers) _ (Percentage of
  customers you can serve) _ (Average annual revenue per customer)
- **Approach**:

1. Narrow down to businesses that fit your target profile (e.g., specific
   regions, business sizes).
2. Adjust for businesses that could realistically use your platform.

- **Example**: If 60% of e-commerce businesses fit your target profile:
- SAM = 10,000,000 _ 0.60 _ $2,000 = $12 billion

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

- **Definition**: SOM is the portion of the SAM that you can realistically
  capture, considering your current resources and competition.
- **Calculation**:
- **Formula**: SOM = (Total number of potential customers) _ (Percentage of
  customers you can serve) _ (Percentage of market you can capture) \* (Average
  annual revenue per customer)
- **Approach**:

1. Consider your current capabilities, competition, and realistic market share.
2. Estimate the percentage of SAM you can capture in the near term.

- **Example**: If you estimate capturing 1% of your SAM in the next 3 years:
- SOM = 10,000,000 _ 0.60 _ 0.01 \* $2,000 = $120 million

### Key Considerations

- Use current market data and adjust these calculations based on your specific
  e-commerce SaaS offering and target market.
- Consider factors like geographical location, industry verticals, and customer
  segments that you can realistically serve.
- Analyze your market share goals and competitive positioning to determine the
  realistic percentage of the SAM you can capture.

### Serviceable Available Market (SAM)

- **Definition**: SAM is the segment of the TAM targeted by TradeWizz that is
  within its geographical and operational reach.
